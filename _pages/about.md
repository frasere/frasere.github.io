Using the statistical and mathematical modelling experience gained during his Doctorate, Fraser worked full time for a leading renewable energy company on the development of Python tools to predict tidal turbine performance. This work was assisted by his original engineering degree experience where the importance of data and method was gained. This combination of skills and experience enabled him to gain a place on a world leading machine learning training program. He is currently working as Data Scientist in the gaming industry.
